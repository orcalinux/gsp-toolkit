# gsp-toolkit
gsp-toolkit implements the General Serial Protocol (GSP) over UART, handling Command-Response-ACK framing, SLIP encoding/decoding, optional CRC-16 error detection, session management, timeouts, and retry logic. It provides an API for host applications to reliably communicate with embedded targets.
